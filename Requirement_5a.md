# Simple Python Calculator Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Python calculator that can currently perform addition and subtraction. Your task is to extend the calculator by adding two more operations: multiplication and division.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open the repository in a codespace.  Make sure you have the Python extension installed.

### 2. Review the Existing Code
Open the `calculator.py` file. The current script includes the following features:
- Addition function (`add`)
- Subtraction function (`subtract`)
- A basic menu that allows users to choose between addition and subtraction

### 3. Add the Missing Functions
Your task is to add two new functions:
- **Multiply**: Write a `multiply(x, y)` function that returns the product of `x` and `y`.
- **Divide**: Write a `divide(x, y)` function that returns the result of `x` divided by `y`. Be sure to handle the case where `y` is 0 to avoid a division by zero error.

### 4. Update the Calculator Menu
After writing the `multiply` and `divide` functions:
- Update the calculator menu to include options for multiplication and division.
- Add logic to handle the userâ€™s choice for these operations.

### 5. Test Your Code
Run the calculator program to ensure your new functions work correctly. Test with different numbers to verify that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division all function as expected.
